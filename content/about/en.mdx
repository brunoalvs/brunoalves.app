<HeadingTitle>About Me</HeadingTitle>
<HeadingSubtitle>Front End Developer & Beginner to UI Designer</HeadingSubtitle>

In these years as a front end developer, I had the pleasure of participating
in various projects for different clients. My know-how allows me to build
products and deliver solutions solid to the client and my knowledge in front
end development also helps me to create user interfaces and experiences that
don't just look good, but also are easy to implement. Hey, developers, we can
make the world a whole other world.

Ei, desenvolvedores, podemos tornar a vida um do outro mais fácil.
