## About Me

### I'm not good at writing

<article className="teste">
  In these years as a front end developer, I had the pleasure of participating
  in various projects for different clients. My know-how allows me to build
  products and deliver solutions solid to the client and my knowledge in front
  end development also helps me to create user interfaces and experiences that
  don't just look good, but also are easy to implement. Hey, developers, we can
  make the world a whole other world.

Hey devs, fuck you!
